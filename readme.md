#### Part I

    "Be natural and yourself and this gilthering flattery
    will be as the passing breeze of the sea on a warm summer
    day".
    
    Our cultural values almost try to make us dependent on validation
    entitled, and ruled by our emotions.
    
    
##### TALK.TALK, TALK

    Those who know do not speak.
    Those who speak do not know.
    Lao Tzu.
    
    The ability to deliberately keep yourself without
    its validation. Silence is the respite of the confident
    and the strong.
    
##### TO BE OR TO DO

    In this formative period, the soul is unsoiled by 
    warfare with the world. It lies, like a block of
    pure , uncut Parian marble, ready to be fashioned into-what?
    Prison swett marden.
    
    Appareances are deceiving. Having authoroty is not the same
    as being an authority. Having the right and beign right are
    not the same either. 
    
##### BECAME A STUDENT.

    Let no Man's Ghost come back to say
    My Training let me down.
    Sign in the new york fire department
    training academy.
    
    The pretense of knowledge is our most dangerous
    vice, because it prevents us from getting any better.
    Studious self-assessment is the antidote.
    
##### DON'T BE PASSIONATE

    You seem to want that vivida vis animi which spurs 
    and excites most young men to please, to shine, to excel.
    Without the desire and the pains necessary to be considerable,
    depend upon it you never can be so
    Lord Chesterfield.
    
    Passion typically masks a weakness.Its breathlessness andimpetuousnesss 
    and franticness are poor substitutes for discipline, for 
    mastery for strenght and purpose and perseverance.
    You need to be able to spot this in others and in yourself.
    because while the origins of passion may be earnest and good,
    its effects are comical and the monstruous.
    
##### Follow the canvas strategy.

    Great man have almost always shown themselves
    as ready to obey as they afterwards proved
    able to command.
    Lord Mahon.
    
    Greatness comes from humble beginnings, it comes
    from grunt work. It means you're the least important
    person in the room. "Say littl, do much".
    The person who clears the path iltimately controls
    its direction, just as the canvas shapes the painting.
    
##### Restraint yourself

    But you're not able to change the system
    until after you've made it.In the meantime you'll
    have to find some way
    to make it suit your purposes-even if those purposes
    are just extra time to develop properly, to learn from
    others on their dime, to build your base and establish
    yourself.
    
##### Get out of your own head.

    A person who thinks all the time has nothing
    to think about except thoughts, so he loses
    touch with reality and lives in a word of illusions.
    
    There's no one to perform for. There us just work
    to be done and lessons to be learned, in all that
    is around us.
    
    
##### THe danger of early pride

    A proud man is always looking down on things
    and people, and , of course,as long as you
    are looking down, you cannot see something
    that is above you
    CS LEWIS
    
##### Work,work,work

    The best plan is only good intentions
    unless it degenerates into work.
    
    You can't build a reputation on what you're going 
    to do.
    "The hard thing isn't setting a big, hairym audacious 
    goal. The hard thing is laying people off when you miss the
    big goal..The hard thing isn't dreaming big. The hard
    thing is waking up in the middle of the night in a cold
    sweat when the dream turns into a nightmare.
