    "Be natural and yourself and this gilthering flattery
    will be as the passing breeze of the sea on a warm summer
    day".
    
    Our cultural values almost try to make us dependent on validation
    entitled, and ruled by our emotions.

    Those who know do not speak.
    Those who speak do not know.
    Lao Tzu.
    
    The ability to deliberately keep yourself without
    its validation. Silence is the respite of the confident
    and the strong.
